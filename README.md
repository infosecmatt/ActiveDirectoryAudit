# ActiveDirectoryAudit
The purpose of this script is to facilitate the auditing process for Active Directory, whether it be for compliance, governance, or security reasons. It is not comprehensive, but it is meant to streamline the process and minimize the back and forth between auditors and IT.

This script is based on AuditorClay's AD audit script.
