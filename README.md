# Security Audit Automation Suite
The purpose of this project is to facilitate the auditing process for enterprise networks and systems, whether it be for compliance, governance, or security reasons. It is not comprehensive, but it is meant to streamline the process and automate many of the tasks typically performed manually by auditors and their respective clients without the use of third party tools or software.

The Active Directory audit script was originally based on Clay Risenhoover's script (https://github.com/AuditClay/AuditScripts/blob/master/ADAuditGeneric.ps1) and Trip Hillman, one of my coworkers and an infosec whiz (https://github.com/th3auditor), assisted with the ideation and testing process.
